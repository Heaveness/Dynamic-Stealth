CURRENTLY WORKING ON ===================================================

Detail HUD filter (server-side, to keep compatible with some existing core systems and some upcoming features)

Directional indicators...
...add optional "damaged from" indicator, which draws an indicator pointing the direction damage was recently received from
...add optional touch detection indicator for players (see to do in DynamicStealth.java)

Add optional reticle which draws on focused entity (if there is one, and it is visible)



GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS, SYSTEMS, AND FEATURES ============================

"Climbing" item trait; item filter for weapons/tools that can be used for climbing...
...climbing tools are effective on vertical surfaces of a lower mining level than their material
...when wielding one climbing tool, you can catch yourself / hold yourself on vertical surfaces
...when wielding two, you can climb up vertical surfaces
...both features use durability

"Potion Applier" item trait; item filter for weapons that can have potions applied to them

"Noisiness" block trait; block filter to determine how much noise walking/running/landing makes

"Footprint Duration" block trait; block filter for how long visible footprints/tracks last on the block type.  Add (long to short); clay, snow, sand, mycelium, dirt, coarse dirt, podzol

Make held items, armor, elytra, etc. fade with entity?

Add disguise system; conditionally prevents targeting even if seen, but not if the enemy has threat against you...
...for AI, probably call the method for this check in EntitySensesEdit#canSee()
...make it so skulls use disguise system instead of doing a stealth multiplier
...make it so morphing into a creature using Morph mod acts as a disguise against that mob type
...for players, this may be more complicated, and involve sending fake entities...

Use tracking system (Tracking class) for something, or remove it



BUG FIXES ==============================================================

Fix entities attempting to path through diagonal walls; this may very well fix (or at least mostly fix) the issue below
Fix entities being able to attack through glass diagonally (because they can see through it...)

Make stuck detection account for jumping by allowing for more play along y axis

Fix leashes not rendering sometimes (not a vanilla bug)...
...can reproduce by leashing a horse, flying into the air, and dropping into water while facing down



KEYBOUND ACTIONS =======================================================

Add action wheel which opens on keybind
Add actions...
...Attempt Stealth / Don't Attempt Stealth (if set to "Don't Attempt Stealth", you are very easy for things to notice)
...Wave (decrease visual stealth for 1 second)
...Whisper (make a small noise; "psst")
...Yell (make a loud noise; "hey")
...Prone/unprone - has a charge time; when prone, you are stealthier, slower, have a lower POV, have a smaller hitbox (can move through 1b high areas), and cannot jump/dodge/sneak
...Find pebble?



CONFIG =================================================================

Add config option for "Can See Through" Materials
Add config option for "Can See Through" Blocks

Add entity-specific configs for helper system



VISUAL INDICATORS ======================================================

Add indicator for where a mob WAS when you last saw it...
...show the mob, as it was last seen, but black and white with partial transparency
...make the on-point HUD above it into an X with coloration

Add target locking (press button to lock/unlock on current target)

Add to HUD...
...light
...combined stealth multiplier?



AI =====================================================================

Can probably combine the two below into a single AI task...
...Replace EntityAILookIdle with a new version that has gradual head rotation, instead of just removing it
...Change "wandering" AI so that it can't instantly flip a 180 (force it to turn gradually before moving in the chosen direction)



SENSES =================================================================

Add sound-based detection
Apply stealth-based sound attributes

Add scent-based detection (wolves, cats, bears)
...Add the ability for entities to smell not only other living entities, but also ground items, etc.
Apply stealth-based scent attributes



STATUS EFFECTS =========================================================

Keen Nose: Get visible indicators for scents and scent trails
Silenced: Cannot warn others
Deafened: Cannot hear
Fear: Makes them flee
Courage: Applies rally effect if they were fleeing; grants immunity to fleeing for the duration

Doom: Instant death if it is not removed before the countdown hits 0.  OP if not filtered carefully
Voidwalker: Allows you to walk on / place blocks on the void at the bottom of the world, as if it were solid; mostly useful in the end
Wet: Triggers if you touch water.  If you are burning at any time for its duration, it removes burning and then removes itself
Frozen: Triggers if you touch ice while wet.  Removes wet and stops movement until you take damage once or the duration runs out.  If you start burning while frozen, frozen and burning are both removed.
Burning: Triggers when set on fire, and sets you on fire when it is triggered.  Puts out the fire when it ends...basically just trying to link normal burning to a usable potion effect



BLOCKS =================================================================

Punji (wood/reed): Deals medium damage + bonus damage based on movement speed in the correct direction, then breaks

Pitfall: TE which destroys the dirt block it's on if something walks on it.



ITEMS ==================================================================

Water potions...yes...for applying the wetness effect (for normal one, try to make it usable faster and play water splash sound)
Fire potions, for burning effect

Water arrows (create a thin flowing water block on impact; for breaking torches and giving Wet status effect)
Fire arrows (set entities on fire or create fire on impact)
Torch arrows (yes I know some other mods already do, but I want them in mine)

Make sticks throwable (act like snowballs; 0 damage projectile, but if they hit a block, then instead create small sound.  Either way, drop as stick item again)

Add guidebook, possibly using guide api or patchouli

Smoke bombs - Block LOS

Hand mirror - Allows you to peek around corners (changes camera position while in use, based on which hand it is in)

Pebbles - Can be thrown as a 0 damage projectile like a snowball, but drops as an item again on impact.  Crafted from cobblestone

Darts - Dan be thrown as a low damage weapon, and can have potions applied to them

Blowpipe - Can fire darts as a weapon, or can be used to breathe underwater, when an air block is near

Make firework stars throwable; they go off after a short delay, or if in water, drop as an item again

Slingshot - Can fire pebbles, smoke bombs, splash/lingering potions, or firework stars as low-damage projectiles

Kunai - Melee/throwing weapon; can be used to craft Rope Dart, stacks up to 4

Rope Dart - Re-usable medium range thrown weapon with 3 second chargeup

Shuriken - Throwing weapon; stacks up to 8

Caltrops - Create a small entity which damages and slows a running entity with a %chance (destroyed if so).  Can be spam-used to leave a trail.  Can be right-clicked to pick up

Kama

Grappling hook - Only works if it latches to something

Chain - Material crafted from 3 iron ingots

Kusarigama - Crafted from a kama, a chain, and an iron ingot.  Cannot be used as a grappling hook, but if no offhand is equipped, right click acts like a rope dart attack (but only kama attack can have potions applied)

Tabi - Footwear that silences your movement noise (no protection)

Mossy Tabi - Like Tabi, but also reduces your chance of leaving footprints

Add armor/baubles that improve stealth/anti-stealth attributes



MOBS ===================================================================

Ninjas...
...Ninjas try to use stealth mechanics
...Make ninjas sometimes disguise themselves as players who play on the server, but with slight typos in the nametag
...If they kill a player while disguised, it still says the player was killed by a ninja, to help prevent confused players raging at each other

Gray Men...
...Gray men are considered invisible if you are facing them directly
...When they were visible, but are no longer visible, stop sending updates to client, but *don't* tell client to remove them; this should cause an illusion that they are holding still



MOD COMPATIBILITY ======================================================

Add bright mobs from mods to EntitySightDefaults.naturallyBrightEntities

Lycanite's Mobs can still attack through walls; probably using different LOS

Lycanite's Mobs have their own EntityAILookIdle which needs removing/replacing

Zombie Awareness (after all senses are done; even then, might need to make an API and have Corosis do the rest from his side)
