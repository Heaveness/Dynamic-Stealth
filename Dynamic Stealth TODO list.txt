CURRENTLY WORKING ON ===================================================

Fix opaque flash when an entity leaves view

Look into github issue #11 (pathfinding NPE crash; almost certainly another mod which alters the pathfinding)

Add potion effect for soul sight

Check out github issue #9 (configurable stealth buffs feature request)

Add config option for "Can See Through" Materials
Add config option for "Can See Through" Blocks



BUG FIXES ==============================================================

Fix mobs in search mode periodically NOT doing the search, but going back to it later...
...noticed with spider, and so far I think it is specific to spiders?

Fix mobs not moving to last known position before searching when too far away...
...Create function which, when beyond normal pathfinding range...
...finds a partial path instead of a full path, and follows it...
...then if not at the final destination, finds another partial path and follows it...
...etc.
This system, if improved upon, could be used for most pathfinding and should improve pathfinding performance (by splitting it up and calculating parts at different times)



THREAT SYSTEM ==========================================================

Make owned entities change their threat based on their owner's actions (eg. see AIHurtByTargetEdit and AIOwnerHurtByTargetEdit)



VISUAL INDICATORS ======================================================

Add optional "damaged from" indicator, which draws an edge-of-screen arrow pointing the direction damage was recently received from

Add optional reticle which draws on focused entity (if there is one, and it is visible)

Add target locking (press button to lock/unlock on current target)

Add to HUD...
...light
...speed
...combined stealth multiplier?

Add the ability to see mob FOVs (as a 3D render), maybe when under a potion effect or something



AI =====================================================================

Can probably combine the two below into a single AI task...
...Replace EntityAILookIdle with a new version that has gradual head rotation, instead of just removing it
...Change "wandering" AI so that it can't instantly flip a 180 (force it to turn gradually before moving in the chosen direction)

Make it so mobs on the same team can tell each other where you are / where they last saw you



SENSES =================================================================

Improve vision detection by allowing entities to see parts of other entities besides just their eyes (right now they only "have LOS" if they have LOS to each others' eyes)

Add touch-based detection (within very close range)
Add general config option for touch-based detection
Add entity-specific config option for touch-based detection

Add sound-based detection
Apply stealth-based sound attributes

Add scent-based detection (wolves, cats, bears)
...Add the ability for entities to smell not only other living entities, but also ground items, etc.
Apply stealth-based scent attributes



ITEMS ==================================================================

Add a stealth guidebook

Add smoke bombs which block LOS

Add hand mirror, which allows you to peek around corners (changes camera position while in use, based on which hand it is in)

Add armor/baubles that improve stealth/anti-stealth attributes



MOBS ===================================================================

Ninjas...
...Ninjas try to use stealth mechanics
...Make ninjas sometimes disguise themselves as players who play on the server, but with slight typos in the nametag
...If they kill a player while disguised, it still says the player was killed by a ninja, to help prevent confused players raging at each other

Gray Men...
...Gray men are considered invisible if you are facing them directly
...When they were visible, but are no longer visible, stop sending updates to client, but *don't* tell client to remove them; this should cause an illusion that they are holding still



MUSIC ==================================================================

Possibly change music using ActualMusic when going into battle, etc



MOD COMPATIBILITY ======================================================

Figure out why the TF2 sentry gun constantly loses target with DS installed (if it's not in threat bypass mode)
Does having DS installed cause TF2 bullet streaks to not show?

Techgun mobs don't build damage threat, because techguns is cancelling the LivingHurtEvent

Lycanite's Mobs can still attack through walls; probably using different LOS

Lycanite's Mobs have their own EntityAILookIdle which needs removing/replacing

Look into crash with Deadly Mobs and its haunted cows...
...https://paste.ee/p/gnVtK
...apparently haunted cows are also not supposed to look haunted until they get hit

Make temporary BackStab compat module? (BackStab issue #4 and #2)

Look into issue where "entities don't always notice you right away"...
...Epic Siege Mod
...Mo' Creatures
...I'm guessing this is probably due to a custom AI based on one of the vanilla AIs with a "chance" of seeing you
