Add stealth GUI that shows stealth aspect levels


Add visible indicators when mobs detect you, lose you, etc (like in Rogue Lab)


Add smoke bombs which block LOS


Add stealth-based attributes for armor (ie, actual attributes; like how armor ratings are an attribute, I think?)


Re-add and implement "noticed" visibility multiplier


Add optional per-entity setting overrides in config, and use them to increase ghast sight distance
Include natural nightvision settings here


Don't send entity data of unseen entities to players, including potion effects.
Make sure entities that *were* seen and are no longer seen are..."gone" on client-side


Add touch-based detection (within very close range)
Add sound-based detection
Add smell-based detection (wolves, cats, bears)


Add the ability to see mob FOVs (as a cone render), maybe when under a potion effect or something





Maybe in this mod, or maybe in addon mods...


Add armor/bauble that gives stealth bonus
Add armor/bauble that gives awareness bonus


NINJAS (probably a separate mod)
