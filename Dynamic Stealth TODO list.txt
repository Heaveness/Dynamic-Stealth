CURRENTLY WORKING ON ===================================================

Add per-entity HUD which only displays a color and a percentage...
...render the stored data, as one or both of...
1. an in-world render, maybe rendering from the livingentity render
2. a HUD render, but using correct scaling (like nameplates).  Can also make them not overlap each other using this method

Look into https://github.com/rafradek/Mods/issues/47

Make it so targetless entities can still build threat (beyond the initial value)

Check out github issue #9 (configurable stealth buffs feature request)



ONGOING TASKS ==========================================================

Fix any mobs that are incorrectly detected as passive / non-passive...
...if this is still an issue, maybe look into whether journeymap handles it well or not and use it as reference?

Fix crashes due to null attack target syndrome...
...(not currently aware of any unfixed)



BUG FIXES ==============================================================

Fix Endermen

Go through all code and make sure it only executes on the necessary side

Fix mobs in search mode periodically NOT doing the search, but going back to it later...
...noticed with spider, and so far I think it is specific to spiders?

Fix mobs not moving to last known position before searching when too far away...
...Create function which, when beyond normal pathfinding range...
...finds a partial path instead of a full path, and follows it...
...then if not at the final destination, finds another partial path and follows it...
...etc.
This system, if improved upon, could be used for most pathfinding and should improve pathfinding performance (by splitting it up and calculating parts at different times)



RELEVANT TO FAERUN HEROES ==============================================

How should the hooks into the system function?  Direct method access?  Custom forge events?  Something else?  ...attributes?



THREAT SYSTEM ==========================================================

Make owned entities change their threat based on their owner's actions (eg. see AIHurtByTargetEdit and AIOwnerHurtByTargetEdit)



CONFIG FILE ============================================================

Add entity-specific isPassive option...
...doesn't make an entity passive or non-passive; just makes the system detect it as passive or non-passive
...add ebwizardry:wizard as non-passive

Add entity-specific threat bypass option...
...then transfer all current threat bypasses to it as default config options



VISUAL INDICATORS ======================================================

Add visible indicators when mobs detect you, lose you, etc (somewhat similar to Mark of the Ninja)
"!" when target spotted
"!?" when target not sensed, includes when "remotely alerted" due to "reinforcement calling"
"?" when starting to search an area
"..." when target is lost (giving up search / going out-of-combat)

Add to HUD...
...light
...speed
...combined stealth multiplier?

Add the ability to see mob FOVs (as a 3D render), maybe when under a potion effect or something



AI =====================================================================

Make guardians NOT attack squid

Can probably combine the two below into a single AI task...
...Replace EntityAILookIdle with a new version that has gradual head rotation, instead of just removing it
...Change "wandering" AI so that it can't instantly flip a 180 (force it to turn gradually before moving in the chosen direction)

Make it so mobs on the same team can tell each other where you are / where they last saw you



SENSES =================================================================

Improve vision detection by allowing entities to see parts of other entities besides just their eyes (right now they only "have LOS" if they have LOS to each others' eyes)

Implement server-side usePlayerSenses config option...
...Make entities that *are* seen easily visible on client (because your character saw them)
...Don't send entity data of unseen entities to players, including potion effects
...Make sure entities that *were* seen and are no longer seen are..."gone" on client-side

Add touch-based detection (within very close range)
Add sound-based detection
Add smell-based detection (wolves, cats, bears)
...Add the ability for entities to smell not only other living entities, but also ground items, etc.

Make it so mobs can see through glass (but maybe not quite yet; for now it's good for watching/debugging their behavior when they're searching for you)



ITEMS ==================================================================

Add a stealth guidebook

Add smoke bombs which block LOS

Add hand mirror, which allows you to peek around corners (changes camera position while in use, based on which hand it is in)

Add stealth-based attributes for armor (ie, actual attributes; like how armor ratings are an attribute, I think?)

Add armor/baubles that improve stealth/anti-stealth attributes



MOBS ===================================================================

Ninjas...
...Ninjas try to use stealth mechanics
...Make ninjas sometimes disguise themselves as players who play on the server, but with slight typos in the nametag
...If they kill a player while disguised, it still says the player was killed by a ninja, to help prevent confused players raging at each other

Gray Men...
...Gray men are considered invisible if you are facing them directly
...When they were visible, but are no longer visible, stop sending updates to client, but *don't* tell client to remove them; this should cause an illusion that they are holding still



MUSIC ==================================================================

Possibly change music using ActualMusic when going into battle, etc



MOD COMPATIBILITY ======================================================

Lycanite's Mobs can still attack through walls; probably using different LOS

Lycanite's Mobs have their own EntityAILookIdle which needs removing/replacing

Look into crash with Deadly Mobs and its haunted cows...
...https://paste.ee/p/gnVtK
...apparently haunted cows are also not supposed to look haunted until they get hit

Make temporary BackStab compat module? (BackStab issue #4 and #2)

Look into issue where "entities don't always notice you right away"...
...Epic Siege Mod
...Mo' Creatures
...I'm guessing this is probably due to a custom AI based on one of the vanilla AIs with a "chance" of seeing you
