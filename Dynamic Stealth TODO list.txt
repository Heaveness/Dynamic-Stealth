CURRENTLY WORKING ON ===================================================

Fix crashes caused by other devs' ai not checking their attack target for null before accessing it in their updateTask() methods...
...might be able to fix it by selectively setting task.using to false for certain tasks if the attack target is null
...if a fix besides AI replacement is found, some existing vanilla AI replacement may no longer be necessary
...applies to com.lycanitesmobs.core.entity.ai.EntityAIAttackMelee
...applies to net.shadowmage.ancientwarfare.npc.ai.vehicle.NpcAIAimVehicle

Add per-entity HUD which only displays a color and a percentage...
...make it an in-world render?  Maybe rendering from the livingentity render?



BUG FIXES ==============================================================

Look into possible bug where "entities don't always notice you right away"...
...I'm guessing this was probably a modded mob, with a custom AI based on one of the vanilla AIs with a "chance" of seeing you

Fix mobs in search mode periodically NOT doing the search, but going back to it later...
...noticed with spider, and so far I think it is specific to spiders?

Fix mobs not moving to last known position before searching when too far away...
...Create function which, when beyond normal pathfinding range...
...finds a partial path instead of a full path, and follows it...
...then if not at the final destination, finds another partial path and follows it...
...etc.
This system, if improved upon, could be used for most pathfinding and should improve pathfinding performance (by splitting it up and calculating parts at different times)



RELEVANT TO FAERUN HEROES ==============================================

How should the hooks into the system function?  Direct method access?  Custom forge events?  Something else?  ...attributes?



THREAT SYSTEM ==========================================================

Make owned entities change their threat based on their owner's actions (eg. see AIHurtByTargetEdit and AIOwnerHurtByTargetEdit)



CONFIG FILE ============================================================

Add threat bypass option

Add entity-specific threat bypass option



VISUAL INDICATORS ======================================================

Add visible indicators when mobs detect you, lose you, etc (somewhat similar to Mark of the Ninja)
"!" when target spotted
"!?" when target not sensed, includes when "remotely alerted" due to "reinforcement calling"
"?" when starting to search an area
"..." when target is lost (giving up search / going out-of-combat)

Add to HUD...
...light
...speed
...combined stealth multiplier?

Add the ability to see mob FOVs (as a 3D render), maybe when under a potion effect or something



AI =====================================================================

Can probably combine the two below into a single AI task...
...Replace EntityAILookIdle with a new version that has gradual head rotation, instead of just removing it
...Change "wandering" AI so that it can't instantly flip a 180 (force it to turn gradually before moving in the chosen direction)

Make it so mobs on the same team can tell each other where you are / where they last saw you



SENSES =================================================================

Improve vision detection by allowing entities to see parts of other entities besides just their eyes (right now they only "have LOS" if they have LOS to each others' eyes)

Add and implement server-side usePlayerSenses config option...
...Don't send entity data of unseen entities to players, including potion effects.
...Replace usePlayerSenses dummy var in Threat class
...Make sure entities that *were* seen and are no longer seen are..."gone" on client-side

Add touch-based detection (within very close range)
Add sound-based detection
Add smell-based detection (wolves, cats, bears)
...Add the ability for entities to smell not only other living entities, but also ground items, etc.

Make it so mobs can see through glass (but maybe not quite yet; for now it's good for watching/debugging their behavior when they're searching for you)



ITEMS ==================================================================

Add a stealth guidebook

Add smoke bombs which block LOS

Add hand mirror, which allows you to peek around corners (changes camera position while in use, based on which hand it is in)

Add stealth-based attributes for armor (ie, actual attributes; like how armor ratings are an attribute, I think?)

Add armor/baubles that improve stealth/anti-stealth attributes



MOBS ===================================================================

NINJAS (probably a separate mod)
Make ninjas sometimes disguise themselves as players who play on the server, but with slight typos in the nametag
If they kill a player while disguised, it still says the player was killed by a ninja, to help prevent confused players raging at each other



MUSIC ==================================================================

Possibly change music using ActualMusic when going into battle, etc



MOD COMPATIBILITY ======================================================

Check issue with BWM AI tasks, specifically for HC Hunting

Check Special AI Revival

Check Rough Mobs 2

Check Epic Siege Mod

Make temporary BackStab compat module? (BackStab issue #4 and #2)
