VISUAL INDICATORS ======================================================

Add visible indicators when mobs detect you, lose you, etc (somewhat similar to Mark of the Ninja)

Add stealth HUD that shows SOME stealth aspect levels...
...light
...speed
...combined stealth multiplier?

Don't send entity data of unseen entities to players, including potion effects.
Make sure entities that *were* seen and are no longer seen are..."gone" on client-side

Add the ability to see mob FOVs (as a cone render), maybe when under a potion effect or something



AI =====================================================================

Change "wandering" AI so that it can't instantly flip a 180 (force it to turn gradually before moving in the chosen direction)
Do the same for the movement part of the "search" AI that occurs after the spin

Replace EntityAILookIdle with a new version that has gradual head rotation, instead of just removing it




SENSES =================================================================

Separate the horizontal and vertical FOV angles, so that each can be configured separately

Re-add and implement "noticed" visibility multiplier

Add optional per-entity setting overrides in config, and use them to increase ghast sight distance
Include natural nightvision settings here

Add touch-based detection (within very close range)
Add sound-based detection
Add smell-based detection (wolves, cats, bears)



ITEMS ==================================================================

Add smoke bombs which block LOS

Add stealth-based attributes for armor (ie, actual attributes; like how armor ratings are an attribute, I think?)

Add armor/baubles that improve stealth/anti-stealth attributes



MOBS ===================================================================

NINJAS (probably a separate mod)
