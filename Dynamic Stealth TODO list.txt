BUG FIXES ==============================================================

Make Speedometer account for dim changes/teleports

Make temporary BackStab compat module? (BackStab issue #4 and #2)

Fix mobs in search mode periodically NOT doing the search, but going back to it later?
...noticed with spider, and so far I think it is specific to spiders?

Fix mobs not moving to last known position before searching when too far away...
...Create function which, when beyond normal pathfinding range...
...finds a partial path instead of a full path, and follows it...
...then if not at the final destination, finds another partial path and follow it...
...etc.
This system, if improved upon, could be used for most pathfinding and should improve pathfinding performance (by splitting it up and calculating parts at different times)



RELEVANT TO FAERUN HEROES ==============================================

How should the hooks into the system function?  Direct method access?  Custom forge events?  Something else?  ...attributes?



THREAT SYSTEM ==========================================================

Make owned entities change their threat based on their owner's actions (eg. see AIHurtByTargetEdit and AIOwnerHurtByTargetEdit)




CONFIG FILE ============================================================

See if MC restart can be removed from some options

Add entity-specific config options for...
...head turn speed
...attention span



VISUAL INDICATORS ======================================================

Make HUD display orange instead of yellow when it has threat but no target
Make HUD display yellow when it has threat and target but can't see target (and is currently searching)

Add visible indicators when mobs detect you, lose you, etc (somewhat similar to Mark of the Ninja)
"!" when target spotted
"!?" when target not sensed, includes when "remotely alerted" due to "reinforcement calling"
"?" when starting to search an area
"..." when target is lost (giving up search / going out-of-combat)

Add to HUD...
...light
...speed
...combined stealth multiplier?

Add the ability to see mob FOVs (as a cone render), maybe when under a potion effect or something



AI =====================================================================

Can predicates be used in a way that allows for reduced AI task replacement?

Make search AI use the same speeds as attack AIs

Figure out why entities sometimes have a delayed reaction when they should see you (when not yet alerted)

Can probably combine the two below into a single AI task...
...Replace EntityAILookIdle with a new version that has gradual head rotation, instead of just removing it
...Change "wandering" AI so that it can't instantly flip a 180 (force it to turn gradually before moving in the chosen direction)

Make it so mobs on the same team can tell each other where you are / where they last saw you



SENSES =================================================================

Improve vision detection by allowing entities to see parts of other entities besides just their eyes (right now they only "have LOS" if they have LOS to each others' eyes)

Add and implement server-side usePlayerSenses config option...
...Don't send entity data of unseen entities to players, including potion effects.
...Replace usePlayerSenses dummy var in Threat class
...Make sure entities that *were* seen and are no longer seen are..."gone" on client-side

Make it so mobs can see through glass (but maybe not quite yet; for now it's good for watching/debugging their behavior when they're searching for you)

Separate the horizontal and vertical FOV angles, so that each can be configured separately

Re-add and implement "noticed" visibility multiplier

Add touch-based detection (within very close range)
Add sound-based detection
Add smell-based detection (wolves, cats, bears)
...Add the ability for entities to smell not only other living entities, but also ground items, etc.



ITEMS ==================================================================

Add a stealth guidebook

Add smoke bombs which block LOS

Add hand mirror, which allows you to peek around corners (changes camera position while in use, based on which hand it is in)

Add stealth-based attributes for armor (ie, actual attributes; like how armor ratings are an attribute, I think?)

Add armor/baubles that improve stealth/anti-stealth attributes



MOBS ===================================================================

NINJAS (probably a separate mod)
Make ninjas sometimes disguise themselves as players who play on the server, but with slight typos in the nametag
If they kill a player while disguised, it still says the player was killed by a ninja, to help prevent confused players raging at each other



MUSIC ==================================================================

Possibly change music using ActualMusic when going into battle, etc



MOD COMPATIBILITY ======================================================

Check issue with BWM AI tasks, specifically for HC Hunting

Check issue with Vampirism, where hunters attack the player regardless of whether they're a vampire or not when my mod is installed

Check Special AI Revival

Check Rough Mobs 2

Check Epic Siege Mod
