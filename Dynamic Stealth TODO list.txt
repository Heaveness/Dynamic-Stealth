CURRENTLY WORKING ON ===================================================

Fix warned passives searching instead of running

Add config options which alter events in the event constructors or after they trigger

Change stealth calcs; try to prevent rapid blinking in and out

Migrate old bad AI handling entries to new system, where applicable



BUG FIXES ==============================================================

Fix bug where mobs' body angle is sometimes wrong (pretty sure this is a vanilla bug)...
...may also have something to do with setting previous rotation yaw, maybe try not doing that bit and see what happens

Fix leashes not rendering sometimes? (it shows the knot though...is this a vanilla bug?)



KEYBOUND ACTIONS =======================================================

Add action wheel which opens on keybind
Add actions...
...Attempt Stealth / Don't Attempt Stealth (if set to "Don't Attempt Stealth", you are very easy for things to notice)



CONFIG =================================================================

Add config option for "Can See Through" Materials
Add config option for "Can See Through" Blocks

Add entity-specific configs for helper system



VISUAL INDICATORS ======================================================

Add indicator for where a mob WAS when you last saw it...
...show the mob, as it was last seen, but black and white with partial transparency
...make the on-point HUD above it into an X with coloration

Edge-of-screen indicators...
...sdd optional touch detection indicator for players (see to do in DynamicStealth.java)
...sdd optional "damaged from" indicator, which draws an edge-of-screen arrow pointing the direction damage was recently received from

Add optional reticle which draws on focused entity (if there is one, and it is visible)

Add target locking (press button to lock/unlock on current target)

Add to HUD...
...light
...speed
...combined stealth multiplier?



AI =====================================================================

Can probably combine the two below into a single AI task...
...Replace EntityAILookIdle with a new version that has gradual head rotation, instead of just removing it
...Change "wandering" AI so that it can't instantly flip a 180 (force it to turn gradually before moving in the chosen direction)



SENSES =================================================================

Add sound-based detection
Apply stealth-based sound attributes

Add scent-based detection (wolves, cats, bears)
...Add the ability for entities to smell not only other living entities, but also ground items, etc.
Apply stealth-based scent attributes



ITEMS ==================================================================

Add water arrows (create a thin flowing water block on impact; for breaking torches and giving Wet status effect)
Add "Wet" status effect (if you are burning at any time for its duration, it removes burning and then removes itself)

Add torch arrows (yes I know some other mods already do, but I want them in mine)

Add the ability to apply potions to weapons

Add a stealth guidebook

Add smoke bombs which block LOS

Add hand mirror, which allows you to peek around corners (changes camera position while in use, based on which hand it is in)

Add armor/baubles that improve stealth/anti-stealth attributes



MOBS ===================================================================

Ninjas...
...Ninjas try to use stealth mechanics
...Make ninjas sometimes disguise themselves as players who play on the server, but with slight typos in the nametag
...If they kill a player while disguised, it still says the player was killed by a ninja, to help prevent confused players raging at each other

Gray Men...
...Gray men are considered invisible if you are facing them directly
...When they were visible, but are no longer visible, stop sending updates to client, but *don't* tell client to remove them; this should cause an illusion that they are holding still



MUSIC AND SOUND ========================================================

Possibly change music using ActualMusic when going into battle, etc



MOD COMPATIBILITY ======================================================

Add bright mobs from mods to EntitySightDefaults.naturallyBrightEntities

Slimes and magma cubes do some really weird spinny stuff with both DS and CNPCs installed

CNPCs don't change opacity

Figure out why the TF2 sentry gun constantly loses target with DS installed (if it's not in threat bypass mode)
Does having DS installed cause TF2 bullet streaks to not show?

Lycanite's Mobs can still attack through walls; probably using different LOS

Lycanite's Mobs have their own EntityAILookIdle which needs removing/replacing

Look into crash with Deadly Mobs and its haunted cows...
...https://paste.ee/p/gnVtK
...apparently haunted cows are also not supposed to look haunted until they get hit

Look into issue where "entities don't always notice you right away"...
...Epic Siege Mod
...Mo' Creatures
...I'm guessing this is probably due to a custom AI based on one of the vanilla AIs with a "chance" of seeing you
