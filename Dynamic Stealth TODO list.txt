RELEVANT TO FAERUN HEROES ==============================================

Implement threat system

Fix mobs not searching last known position when too far away...
...Create function which, when beyond normal pathfinding range...
...finds a partial path instead of a full path, and follows it...
...then if not at the final destination, finds another partial path and follow it...
...etc.
This system, if improved upon, could be used for most pathfinding and should improve pathfinding performance



CONFIG FILE ============================================================

Add section for Threat System
Add threat system config options for...
...update frequency
...unseen target degredation multiplier
...unseen target minimum threat

Add section for AI
Add AI config options for...
...head turn speed
...attention span

Add entity-specific config options for...
...head turn speed
...attention span



VISUAL INDICATORS ======================================================

Add visible indicators when mobs detect you, lose you, etc (somewhat similar to Mark of the Ninja)
"!" when target spotted
"!?" when target not sensed
"?" when starting to search an area
"..." when target is lost (giving up search / going out-of-combat)

Add stealth HUD that shows SOME stealth aspect levels...
...light
...speed
...combined stealth multiplier?
For now, just show it as a vertical math equation

Don't send entity data of unseen entities to players, including potion effects.
Make sure entities that *were* seen and are no longer seen are..."gone" on client-side

Add the ability to see mob FOVs (as a cone render), maybe when under a potion effect or something



AI =====================================================================

Make search AI use the same speeds used by attack AIs

Figure out why entities sometimes have a delayed reaction when they should see you (when not yet alerted)
...maybe the targetTasks don't update as often as normal tasks?

Can probably combine the two below into a single AI task...
...Replace EntityAILookIdle with a new version that has gradual head rotation, instead of just removing it
...Change "wandering" AI so that it can't instantly flip a 180 (force it to turn gradually before moving in the chosen direction)

Make it so mobs on the same team can tell each other where you are / where they last saw you



SENSES =================================================================

Make it so mobs can see through glass (but maybe not quite yet; for now it's good for watching/debugging their behavior when they're searching for you)

Separate the horizontal and vertical FOV angles, so that each can be configured separately

Re-add and implement "noticed" visibility multiplier

Add touch-based detection (within very close range)
Add sound-based detection
Add smell-based detection (wolves, cats, bears)



ITEMS ==================================================================

Add a stealth guidebook

Add smoke bombs which block LOS

Add hand mirror, which allows you to peek around corners (changes camera position while in use, based on which hand it is in)

Add stealth-based attributes for armor (ie, actual attributes; like how armor ratings are an attribute, I think?)

Add armor/baubles that improve stealth/anti-stealth attributes



MOBS ===================================================================

NINJAS (probably a separate mod)
Make ninjas sometimes disguise themselves as players who play on the server, but with slight typos in the nametag
If they kill a player while disguised, it still says the player was killed by a ninja, to help prevent confused players raging at each other



MOD COMPATIBILITY ======================================================

Many cases might be solvable with more selective AI replacements on my part, depending on what other mods are installed.
Even a simple required-after may suffice, because if the other mod has already replaced the vanilla AI, then my mod will not find/replace that AI anyway

Check issue with Vampirism, where hunters attack the player regardless of whether they're a vampire or not when my mod is installed

Check Special AI Revival

Check Rough Mobs 2
