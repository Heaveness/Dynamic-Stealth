RELEVANT TO FAERUN HEROES ==============================================

How should the hooks into the system function?  Direct method access?  Custom forge events?  Something else?  ...attributes?



THREAT SYSTEM ==========================================================

Make owned entities change their threat based on their owner's actions (eg. see AIHurtByTargetEdit and AIOwnerHurtByTargetEdit)




CONFIG FILE ============================================================

Add entity-specific config options for...
...head turn speed
...attention span



VISUAL INDICATORS ======================================================

Add visible indicators when mobs detect you, lose you, etc (somewhat similar to Mark of the Ninja)
"!" when target spotted
"!?" when target not sensed, includes when "remotely alerted" due to "reinforcement calling"
"?" when starting to search an area
"..." when target is lost (giving up search / going out-of-combat)

Add to HUD...
...light
...speed
...combined stealth multiplier?

Add the ability to see mob FOVs (as a cone render), maybe when under a potion effect or something



AI =====================================================================

Make search AI use the same speeds as attack AIs

Figure out why entities sometimes have a delayed reaction when they should see you (when not yet alerted)

Can probably combine the two below into a single AI task...
...Replace EntityAILookIdle with a new version that has gradual head rotation, instead of just removing it
...Change "wandering" AI so that it can't instantly flip a 180 (force it to turn gradually before moving in the chosen direction)

Make it so mobs on the same team can tell each other where you are / where they last saw you

Fix mobs not moving to last known position before searching when too far away...
...Create function which, when beyond normal pathfinding range...
...finds a partial path instead of a full path, and follows it...
...then if not at the final destination, finds another partial path and follow it...
...etc.
This system, if improved upon, could be used for most pathfinding and should improve pathfinding performance



SENSES =================================================================

Improve vision detection by allowing entities to see parts of other entities besides just their eyes (right now they only "have LOS" if they have LOS to each others' eyes)

Add and implement server-side usePlayerSenses config option...
...Don't send entity data of unseen entities to players, including potion effects.
...Replace usePlayerSenses dummy var in Threat class
...Make sure entities that *were* seen and are no longer seen are..."gone" on client-side

Make it so mobs can see through glass (but maybe not quite yet; for now it's good for watching/debugging their behavior when they're searching for you)

Separate the horizontal and vertical FOV angles, so that each can be configured separately

Re-add and implement "noticed" visibility multiplier

Add touch-based detection (within very close range)
Add sound-based detection
Add smell-based detection (wolves, cats, bears)
...Add the ability for entities to smell not only other living entities, but also ground items, etc.



ITEMS ==================================================================

Add a stealth guidebook

Add smoke bombs which block LOS

Add hand mirror, which allows you to peek around corners (changes camera position while in use, based on which hand it is in)

Add stealth-based attributes for armor (ie, actual attributes; like how armor ratings are an attribute, I think?)

Add armor/baubles that improve stealth/anti-stealth attributes



MOBS ===================================================================

NINJAS (probably a separate mod)
Make ninjas sometimes disguise themselves as players who play on the server, but with slight typos in the nametag
If they kill a player while disguised, it still says the player was killed by a ninja, to help prevent confused players raging at each other



MOD COMPATIBILITY ======================================================

Do I even need to replace any vanilla AI tasks anymore?  I'm not sure I have a need to do so at this point...
...test this sometime (on a new branch ofc)

*IF* It's still necessary for me to replace AI tasks, look into possible compat issue between DS and BWM AI tasks

Many cases might be solvable with more selective AI replacements on my part, depending on what other mods are installed.
Even a simple required-after may suffice, because if the other mod has already replaced the vanilla AI, then my mod will not find/replace that AI anyway

Check issue with Vampirism, where hunters attack the player regardless of whether they're a vampire or not when my mod is installed

Check Special AI Revival

Check Rough Mobs 2

Check Epic Siege Mod
