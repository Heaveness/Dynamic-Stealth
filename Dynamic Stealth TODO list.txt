CURRENTLY WORKING ON ===================================================

Add disguise system; conditionally prevents targeting even if seen, but not if the enemy has threat against you...
...for AI, probably call the method for this check in EntitySensesEdit#canSee()
...make it so skulls use disguise system instead of doing a stealth multiplier
...make it so morphing into a creature using Morph mod acts as a disguise against that mob type
...for players, this may be more complicated, and involve sending fake entities...

Add new color for threat bypass; very dark grey?

Option to prevent wolves from teleporting

Migrate old bad AI handling entries to new system, where applicable



GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS, SYSTEMS, AND FEATURES ============================

Change stealth calcs; try to prevent rapid blinking in and out

Use tracking system (Tracking class) for something



BUG FIXES ==============================================================

Fix entities attempting to path through diagonal walls; this may very well fix (or at least mostly fix) the issue below
Fix entities being able to attack through glass diagonally (because they can see through it...)

Make stuck detection account for jumping by allowing for more play along y axis

Fix bug where mobs' body angle is sometimes wrong (pretty sure this is a vanilla bug)...
...may also have something to do with setting previous rotation yaw, maybe try not doing that bit and see what happens
...if so, keep in mind that sight algorithm uses previous yaw and notably depends on it when making an entity look a direction then checking sight

Fix leashes not rendering sometimes? (it shows the knot though...is this a vanilla bug?)



KEYBOUND ACTIONS =======================================================

Add action wheel which opens on keybind
Add actions...
...Attempt Stealth / Don't Attempt Stealth (if set to "Don't Attempt Stealth", you are very easy for things to notice)



CONFIG =================================================================

Add config option for "Can See Through" Materials
Add config option for "Can See Through" Blocks

Add entity-specific configs for helper system



VISUAL INDICATORS ======================================================

Add indicator for where a mob WAS when you last saw it...
...show the mob, as it was last seen, but black and white with partial transparency
...make the on-point HUD above it into an X with coloration

Edge-of-screen indicators...
...sdd optional touch detection indicator for players (see to do in DynamicStealth.java)
...sdd optional "damaged from" indicator, which draws an edge-of-screen arrow pointing the direction damage was recently received from

Add optional reticle which draws on focused entity (if there is one, and it is visible)

Add target locking (press button to lock/unlock on current target)

Add to HUD...
...light
...speed
...combined stealth multiplier?



AI =====================================================================

Can probably combine the two below into a single AI task...
...Replace EntityAILookIdle with a new version that has gradual head rotation, instead of just removing it
...Change "wandering" AI so that it can't instantly flip a 180 (force it to turn gradually before moving in the chosen direction)



SENSES =================================================================

Add sound-based detection
Apply stealth-based sound attributes

Add scent-based detection (wolves, cats, bears)
...Add the ability for entities to smell not only other living entities, but also ground items, etc.
Apply stealth-based scent attributes



STATUS EFFECTS =========================================================

Doom: Instant death if it is not removed before the countdown hits 0.  OP if not filtered carefully
Voidwalker: Allows you to walk on / place blocks on the void at the bottom of the world, as if it were solid; mostly useful in the end
Silenced: Cannot warn others
Deafened: Cannot hear
Fear: Makes them flee
Courage: Applies rally effect if they were fleeing; grants immunity to fleeing for the duration

Wet: Triggers if you touch water.  If you are burning at any time for its duration, it removes burning and then removes itself
Frozen: Triggers if you touch ice while wet.  Removes wet and stops movement until you take damage once or the duration runs out.  If you start burning while frozen, frozen and burning are both removed.
Burning: Triggers when set on fire, and sets you on fire when it is triggered.  Puts out the fire when it ends...basically just trying to link normal burning to a usable potion effect



ITEMS ==================================================================

Water potions...yes...for applying the wetness effect (for normal one, try to make it usable faster and play water splash sound)
Fire potions, for burning effect

Water arrows (create a thin flowing water block on impact; for breaking torches and giving Wet status effect)
Fire arrows (set entities on fire or create fire on impact)
Torch arrows (yes I know some other mods already do, but I want them in mine)

Add the ability to apply potions to weapons

Add a stealth guidebook

Add smoke bombs which block LOS

Add hand mirror, which allows you to peek around corners (changes camera position while in use, based on which hand it is in)

Add armor/baubles that improve stealth/anti-stealth attributes



MOBS ===================================================================

Ninjas...
...Ninjas try to use stealth mechanics
...Make ninjas sometimes disguise themselves as players who play on the server, but with slight typos in the nametag
...If they kill a player while disguised, it still says the player was killed by a ninja, to help prevent confused players raging at each other

Gray Men...
...Gray men are considered invisible if you are facing them directly
...When they were visible, but are no longer visible, stop sending updates to client, but *don't* tell client to remove them; this should cause an illusion that they are holding still



MUSIC AND SOUND ========================================================

Possibly change music using ActualMusic when going into battle, etc



MOD COMPATIBILITY ======================================================

Add bright mobs from mods to EntitySightDefaults.naturallyBrightEntities

Lycanite's Mobs can still attack through walls; probably using different LOS

Lycanite's Mobs have their own EntityAILookIdle which needs removing/replacing
