Add stealth GUI that shows stealth aspect levels



Add stealth-based attributes for armor (ie, actual attributes; like how armor ratings are an attribute, I think?)



Re-add and implement "noticed" visibility multiplier



Add optional per-entity setting overrides in config, and use them to increase ghast sight distance
Include natural nightvision settings here



This gets the follow distance of "searcher":
searcher.getEntityAttribute(SharedMonsterAttributes.FOLLOW_RANGE).getAttributeValue()
See where I want to use it, if at all



don't send entity data of unseen entities to players, including potion effects

show nametags when seen, not when unseen



add touch-based detection (within very close range)
add sound-based detection
add smell-based detection (wolves, cats, bears)



add the ability to see mob FOVs (as a cone render), maybe when under a potion effect or something

add armor/bauble that gives stealth bonus
add armor/bauble that gives awareness bonus
