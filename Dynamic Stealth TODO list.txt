CURRENTLY WORKING ON ===================================================

Add code side of support for Skyrim "eye" style indicator animation

Make it easier for users to find entity registry names to use in the configs

If possible, client-side configs for targeting logic...
...whether it forces a LOS check
...max angle at which a target can be acquired

Add sound-based detection
Apply stealth-based sound attributes

Switch to a one-subscriber system for events, to reduce invoke() calls from the event bus

Look into using instances of MethodHandle instead of reflection where possible

Make stealth level / visibility transitions smoother? (ie. change at a rate)

Directional indicators...
...add optional "damaged from" indicator, which draws an indicator pointing the direction damage was recently received from
...add optional touch detection indicator for players (see to do in DynamicStealth.java)

"Lock Target" key (press to lock/unlock current target)
"Aim Assist" key (hold to automatically face current target)

Remove special filter for ice and fire mobs when they release the fix on their side (they already fixed in a commit, it's just not released yet)



BUG FIXES ==============================================================

Villagers run WAY too fast

Spiders can home in on their threat target even if they can't see it

Fix entities attempting to path through diagonal walls; this may very well fix (or at least mostly fix) the issue below
Fix entities being able to attack through glass diagonally (because they can see through it...)

Make stuck detection account for jumping by allowing for more play along y axis

Fix leashes not rendering sometimes (not a vanilla bug)...
...can reproduce by leashing a horse, flying into the air, and dropping into water while facing down



GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS, SYSTEMS, AND FEATURES ============================

"Climbing" item trait; item filter for weapons/tools that can be used for climbing...
...climbing tools are effective on vertical surfaces of a lower mining level than their material
...when wielding one climbing tool, you can catch yourself / hold yourself on vertical surfaces
...when wielding two, you can climb up vertical surfaces
...both features use durability

"Potion Applier" item trait; item filter for weapons that can have potions applied to them

"Noisiness" block trait; block filter to determine how much noise walking/running/landing makes

"Footprint Duration" block trait; block filter for how long visible footprints/tracks last on the block type.  Add (long to short); clay, snow, sand, mycelium, dirt, coarse dirt, podzol

Make held items, armor, elytra, etc. fade with entity?

Add disguise system; conditionally prevents targeting even if seen, but not if the enemy has threat against you...
...for AI, probably call the method for this check in EntitySensesEdit#canSee()
...make it so skulls use disguise system instead of doing a stealth multiplier
...make it so morphing into a creature using Morph mod or Metamorph mod acts as a disguise against that mob type, or remove the Morph API if it remains unused
...for players, this may be more complicated, and involve sending fake entities...

Use tracking system (Tracking class) for something, or remove it

Add wiki / guide videos
Add guidebook, possibly using guide api or patchouli



KEYBOUND ACTIONS =======================================================

Add action wheel which opens on keybind
Add actions...
...Attempt Stealth / Don't Attempt Stealth (if set to "Don't Attempt Stealth", you are very easy for things to notice)
...Wave (decrease visual stealth for 1 second)
...Whisper (make a small noise; altered villager conversation sound?)
...Yell (make a loud noise; hurt sound?)
...Prone/unprone - has a charge time; when prone, you are stealthier, slower, have a lower POV, have a smaller hitbox (can move through 1b high areas), and cannot jump/dodge/sneak
...Find pebble?



CONFIG =================================================================

Add config option for "Can See Through" Materials
Add config option for "Can See Through" Blocks

Add entity-specific configs for helper system

Add entity-specific filter for OPHUD
Add entity-specific filter for detail HUD



AI =====================================================================

Can probably combine the two below into a single AI task...
...Replace EntityAILookIdle with a new version that has gradual head rotation, instead of just removing it
...Change "wandering" AI so that it can't instantly flip a 180 (force it to turn gradually before moving in the chosen direction)



SENSES =================================================================

Add scent-based detection (wolves, cats, bears)
...Add the ability for entities to smell not only other living entities, but also ground items, etc.
Apply stealth-based scent attributes



STATUS EFFECTS =========================================================

Keen Nose: Get visible indicators for scents and scent trails
Silenced: Cannot warn others
Deafened: Cannot hear
Fear: Makes them flee
Courage: Applies rally effect if they were fleeing; grants immunity to fleeing for the duration



BLOCKS =================================================================

Pitfall: TE which destroys the dirt block it's on if something walks on it.



ITEMS ==================================================================

Water potions...yes...for applying the wetness effect (for normal one, try to make it usable faster and play water splash sound)
Fire potions, for burning effect

Water arrows (create a thin flowing water block on impact; for breaking torches and giving Wet status effect)
Fire arrows (set entities on fire or create fire on impact)
Torch arrows (yes I know some other mods already do, but I want them in mine)

Make sticks throwable (act like snowballs; 0 damage projectile, but if they hit a block, then instead create small sound.  Either way, drop as stick item again)

Hand mirror - Allows you to peek around corners (changes camera position while in use, based on which hand it is in)

Pebbles - Can be thrown as a 0 damage projectile like a snowball, but drops as an item again on impact.  Crafted from cobblestone

Make firework stars throwable; they go off after a short delay, or if in water, drop as an item again

Slingshot - Can fire pebbles, smoke bombs, splash/lingering potions, or firework stars as low-damage projectiles

Grappling hook - Only works if it latches to something



MOBS ===================================================================

Gray Men...
...Gray men are considered invisible if you are facing them directly
...When they were visible, but are no longer visible, stop sending updates to client, but *don't* tell client to remove them; this should cause an illusion that they are holding still



MOD COMPATIBILITY ======================================================

Add bright mobs from mods to EntitySightDefaults.naturallyBrightEntities

Lycanite's Mobs can still attack through walls; probably using different LOS

Lycanite's Mobs have their own EntityAILookIdle which needs removing/replacing

Zombie Awareness (after all senses are done; even then, might need to make an API and have Corosis do the rest from his side)
